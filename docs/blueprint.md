## Style Guidelines:

- Use a dark, muted background color, similar to #1A1A2E, to create a sophisticated and modern feel.
- Employ a contrasting accent color, like a vibrant orange or yellow (#FFB300), for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons to draw attention.
- Use a secondary color, such as a deep blue or purple, to highlight categories and provide visual interest.
- Use a clean and modern sans-serif font like 'Roboto' or 'Open Sans' for body text to ensure readability.
- Use a bolder font for headings and product names to create hierarchy and emphasis.
- Use simple, minimalist icons for navigation and product actions (e.g., 'Add to Bag') to maintain a clean aesthetic.
- Implement a grid-based layout with clear spacing to showcase products effectively.
- Include a prominent search bar at the top of the page for easy product discovery.
- Incorporate a 'Shop by Category' section with visually appealing category buttons or images.
- Provide a clear and concise filtering mechanism (e.g., price range) to help users narrow down their choices.
