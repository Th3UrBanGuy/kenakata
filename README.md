## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Deployment

Follow these steps to get the project running locally and ready for deployment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd kenakata-ecommerce
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

This is the most important step for connecting to your Firebase project.

- Create a new file named `.env` in the root of your project.
- Copy the contents of `.env.example` into your new `.env` file.
- Log in to your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
- Go to **Project settings** (the gear icon) > **General**.
- Under "Your apps", find your web app and look for the `firebaseConfig` object.
- Copy the values from your `firebaseConfig` object into the corresponding variables in your `.env` file.

### 4. Seed the Database (Optional)

To populate your store with initial product data, run the following command. This is essential to see products in the store for the first time.

**Note**: You may need to temporarily open your Firestore security rules to allow writes from a script. A simple rule for seeding is:
`allow write: if true;`
**Remember to secure your rules again after seeding!**

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.

### 6. Create an Admin User

To access the admin panel, you first need to create a regular user through the application's "Sign Up" page. Once the user is created and their email is verified, you can promote them to an admin using this command-line script.

```bash
npm run make:admin -- <user@example.com>
```

### 7. Deploying to Vercel/Netlify

- **Push your code to a GitHub repository.**
- **Import your project** on the Vercel or Netlify dashboard.
- **Configure Environment Variables**: In your Vercel/Netlify project settings, copy all the variables from your `.env` file. **Make sure to prefix all variable names with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`** as required by Next.js for client-side access.
- **Deploy!** The platforms will automatically detect it's a Next.js project and use the correct build commands.

## üìú Available NPM Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Starts the Next.js development server.
- `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
- `npm run start`: Starts the production server after a build.
- `npm run db:seed`: Populates the database with initial products.
